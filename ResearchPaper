Research Paper Week 1 – The God Concept and Something Else

The God concept is sometimes a personification of the forces of nature. Often it is a person’s attempt to understand or define the world around them. The concept of a god provides a pathway for finding meaning in things that may otherwise seem absurd. This seems to be an important element to a civilized world. Be it the glue that holds a community together or the axe that divides, a culture’s relationship with the god concept can dictate so much about the lives of the people involved. These effects can be felt beyond the confines of any one practicing religion. Interfaith interaction is not uncommon in today’s world. Our relationship with our god concept and our faiths’ have even influenced how we interact beyond the celestial body that is Earth.  Somewhere on the moon, it is written;

“To the glory of the name of God who gives such power to men, we ardently pray for this wonderful beginning.”

-	Paul VI Pope
